# Search-Algorithms-in-AI

In this course I solved a game (like an 8 puzzle) so that I have a starting state and a goal state,

and I need to show the shortest or cheapest path (depending on the algorithm) to the goal.

I implemented the following algorithms: BFS, DFID, A*, IDA*, DFBnB.

I built a smart heuristic function.

I solved the problem in a general way that could also fit the solution of 8 puzzles.
